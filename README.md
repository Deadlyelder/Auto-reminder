# Auto-reminder
A quick script written to automated reminder messages so you do not have to worry about sending messages manually.

## Requirements
* macOS with imessage configured

## Setup

1. Modify the name in `message.sh` from `John Doe` to the macOS contact name you wish to message.
2. Modify `install.sh` with the crontab schedule as necessary.

*Note: Currently the cron is set to run on Friday at 3:30 PM each week*

Have fun!
